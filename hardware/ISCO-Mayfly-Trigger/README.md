# Hardware for ISCO-Mayfly-Trigger
This latching contact closure switch was specifically designed to *Inhibit* and *un-Inhibit* (i.e. run) a sampling program for a [ISCO 3700 Portable Sampler](http://www.teledyneisco.com/en-us/waterandwastewater/Pages/3700-Sampler.aspx) or other [ISCO Water and Wastewater Sampler](http://www.teledyneisco.com/en-us/water-and-wastewater/samplers).

This design utilizes two connected [Pololu Mini Pushbutton Power Switch LV](https://www.pololu.com/product/2808) boards ($3.95 each), wired in a clever way modified from an [original design by Bobby Schulz](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Trigger/blob/master/hardware/ISCO-Mayfly-Trigger/BobbbyOriginalDesign_ISCO_Trigger_5-4-2018.pdf).
